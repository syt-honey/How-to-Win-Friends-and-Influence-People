<p>In talking with people, don&apos;t begin by discussing the things on which you differ.</p>
<p>Begin by emphasizing&#x2014;and keep on emphasizing&#x2014;the things on which you agree.</p>
<p>Keep emphasizing, if possible, that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose.</p>
<p>Get the other person saying &quot;Yes, yes&quot; at the outset.</p>
<p>Keep your opponent, if possible, from saying &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>A &quot;No&quot; response, according to Professor Overstreet, is a most difficult handicap to overcome.</p>
<p>When you have said &quot;No,&quot; all your pride of personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself.</p>
<p>You may later feel that the &quot;No&quot; was ill-advised; nevertheless, there is your precious pride to consider!</p>
<p>Once having said a thing, you feel you must stick to it.</p>
<p>Hence it is of the very greatest importance that a person be started in the affirmative direction.</p>
<p>The use of this &quot;yes, yes&quot; technique enabled James Eberson, who was a teller in the Greenwich Savings Bank, in New York City, to secure a prospective customer who might otherwise have been lost.</p>
<p>&quot;This man came in to open an account,&quot; said Mr. Eberson, &quot;and I gave him our usual form to fill out.</p>
<p>Some of the questions he answered willingly, but there were others he flatly refused to answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Before I began the study of human relations, I would have told this prospective depositor that if he refused to give the bank this information, we should have to refuse to accept this account.</p>
<p>I am ashamed that I have been guilty of doing that very thing in the past.</p>
<p>Naturally, an ultimatum like that made me feel good.</p>
<p>I had shown who was boss, that the bank&apos;s rules and regulations couldn&apos;t be flouted.</p>
<p>But that sort of attitude certainly didn&apos;t give a feeling of welcome and importance to the man who had walked in to give us his patronage.</p>
<p>&quot;I resolved this morning to use a little horse sense.</p>
<p>I resolved not to talk about what the bank wanted but about what the customer wanted. And above all else, I was determined to get him saying &apos;yes, yes&apos; from the very start.</p>
<p>So I agreed with him.</p>
<p>I told him the information he refused to give was not absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>&quot; &apos;However,&apos; I said, &apos;suppose you have money in this bank at your death.</p>
<p>Wouldn&apos;t you like to have the bank transfer it to your next of kin, who is entitled to it according to law?&apos;</p>
<p>&quot; &apos;Yes, of course,&apos; he replied.</p>
<p>&quot; &apos;Don&apos;t you think,&apos; I continued, &apos;that it would be a good idea to give us the name of your next of kin so that, in the event of your death, we could carry out your wishes without error or delay?&apos;</p>
<p>&quot;Again he said, &apos;Yes.&apos;</p>
<p>&quot;The young man&apos;s attitude softened and changed when he realized that we weren&apos;t asking for this information for our sake but for his sake.</p>
<p>Before leaving the bank, this young man not only gave me complete information about himself but he opened, at my suggestion, a trust account, naming his mother as the beneficiary for his account, and he had gladly answered all the questions concerning his mother also.</p>
<p>&quot;I found that by getting him to say &apos;yes, yes&apos; from the outset, he forgot the issue at stake and was happy to do all the things I suggested.&quot;</p>
<p>Joseph Allison, a sales representative for Westing house Electric Company, had this story to tell:</p>
<p>&quot;There was a man in my territory that our company was most eager to sell to.</p>
<p>My predecessor had called on him for ten years without selling anything When I took over the territory, I called steadily for three years without getting an order.</p>
<p>Finally, after thirteen years of calls and sales talk, we sold him a few motors.</p>
<p>If these proved to be all right, an order for several hundred more would follow.</p>
<p>Such was my expectation, &quot;Right? I knew they would be all right.</p>
<p>So when I called three weeks later, I was in high spirits.</p>
<p>&quot;The chief engineer greeted me with this shocking announcement: &apos;Allison, I can&apos;t buy the remainder of the motors from you.&apos;</p>
<p>&quot; &apos;Why?&apos; I asked in amazement. &apos;Why?&apos;</p>
<p>&quot; &apos;Because your motors are too hot. I can&apos;t put my hand on them,&apos;</p>
<p>&quot;I knew it wouldn&apos;t do any good to argue.</p>
<p>I had tried that sort of thing too long. So I thought of getting the &apos;yes, yes&apos; response.</p>
<p>&quot; &apos;Well, now look, Mr. Smith,&apos; I said.</p>
<p>I agree with you a hundred percent; if those motors are running too hot, you ought not to buy any more of them.</p>
<p>You must have motors that won&apos;t run any hotter than standards set by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. Isn&apos;t that so?</p>
<p>&quot;He agreed it was. I had gotten my first &apos;yes.&apos;</p>
<p>&quot; &apos;The Electrical Manufacturers Association regulations say that a properly designed motor may have a temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit above room temperature. Is that correct?&apos;</p>
<p>&quot; &apos;Yes,&apos; he agreed.</p>
<p>That&apos;s quite correct.</p>
<p>But your motors are much hotter.&apos;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t argue with him.</p>
<p>I merely asked: &apos;How hot is the mill room?&apos;</p>
<p>&quot; &apos;Oh,&apos; he said, &apos;about 75 degrees Fahrenheit.&apos;</p>
<p>&quot; &apos;Well,&apos; I replied, &apos;if the mill room is 75 degrees and you add 72 to that, that makes a total of 147 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Wouldn&apos;t you scald your hand if you held it under a spigot of hot water at a temperature of 147 degrees Fahrenheit?&apos;</p>
<p>&quot;Again he had to say &apos;yes.&apos;</p>
<p>&quot; &apos;Well,&apos; I suggested, &apos;wouldn&apos;t it be a good idea to keep your hands off those motors?&apos;</p>
<p>&quot; &apos;Well, I guess you&apos;re right,&apos; he admitted.</p>
<p>We continued to chat for a while.</p>
<p>Then he called his secretary and lined up approximately $35,000 worth of business for the ensuing month.</p>
<p>&quot;It took me years and cost me countless thousands of dollars in lost business before I finally learned that it doesn&apos;t pay to argue, that it is much more profitable and much more interesting to look at things from the other person&apos;s viewpoint and try to get that person saying &apos;yes, yes.&apos; &quot;</p>
<p>Eddie Snow, who sponsors our courses in Oakland, California, tells how he became a good customer of a shop because the proprietor got him to say &quot;yes, yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Eddie had become interested in bow hunting and had spent considerable money in purchasing equipment and supplies from a local bow store.</p>
<p>When his brother was visiting him he wanted to rent a bow for him from this store.</p>
<p>The sales clerk told him they didn&apos;t rent bows, so Eddie phoned another bow store.</p>
<p>Eddie described what happened:</p>
<p>&quot;A very pleasant gentleman answered the phone.</p>
<p>His response to my question for a rental was completely different from the other place.</p>
<p>He said he was sorry but they no longer rented bows because they couldn&apos;t afford to do so.</p>
<p>He then asked me if I had rented before.</p>
<p>I replied, &apos;Yes, several years ago.&apos;</p>
<p>He reminded me that I probably paid $25 to $30 for the rental.</p>
<p>I said &apos;yes&apos; again.</p>
<p>He then asked if I was the kind of person who liked to save money.</p>
<p>Naturally, I answered &apos;yes.&apos;</p>
<p>He went on to explain that they had bow sets with all the necessary equipment on sale for $34.95.</p>
<p>I could buy a complete set for only $4.95 more than I could rent one.</p>
<p>He explained that is why they had discontinued renting them.</p>
<p>Did I think that was reasonable?</p>
<p>My &apos;yes&apos; response led to a purchase of the set, and when I picked it up I purchased several more items at this shop and have since become a regular customer.&quot;</p>
<p>Socrates, &quot;the gadfly of Athens,&quot; was one of the greatest philosophers the world has ever known.</p>
<p>He did something that only a handful of men in all history have been able to do:</p>
<p>he sharply changed the whole course of human thought; and now, twenty-four centuries after his death, he is honored as one of the wisest persuaders who ever influenced this wrangling world.</p>
<p>His method? Did he tell people they were wrong?</p>
<p>Oh, no, not Socrates.</p>
<p>He was far too adroit for that.</p>
<p>His whole technique, now called the &quot;Socratic method,&quot; was based upon getting a &quot;yes, yes&quot; response.</p>
<p>He asked questions with which his opponent would have to agree.</p>
<p>He kept on winning one admission after another until he had an armful of yeses.</p>
<p>He kept on asking questions until finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few minutes previously.</p>
<p>The next time we are tempted to tell someone he or she is wrong, let&apos;s remember old Socrates and ask a gentle question&#x2014;a question that will get the &quot;yes, yes&quot; response.</p>
<p>The Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the age-old wisdom of the Orient: &quot;He who treads softly goes far.&quot;</p>
<p>They have spent five thousand years studying human nature, those cultured Chinese, and they have garnered a lot of perspicacity: &quot;He who treads softly goes far.&quot;</p>
<p>Principle 5 - Get the other person saying &quot;yes, yes&quot; immediately.</p>

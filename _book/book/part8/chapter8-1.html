<p>Everyone who was ever a guest of Theodore Roosevelt was astonished at the range and diversity of his knowledge</p>
<p>Whether his visitor was a cowboy or a Rough Rider, a New York politician or a diplomat, Roosevelt knew what to say.</p>
<p>And how was it done? The answer was simple.</p>
<p>Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested.</p>
<p>For Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal road to a person&#x2019;s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.</p>
<p>The genial William Lyon Phelps, essayist and professor of literature at Yale, learned this lesson early in life.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When I was eight years old and was spending a weekend visiting my Aunt Libby Linsley at her home in Stratford on the Housatonic,&#x201D;</p>
<p>he wrote in his essay on Human Nature, &#x201C;a middle-aged man called one evening, and after a polite skirmish with my aunt, he devoted his attention to me.</p>
<p>At that time, I happened to be excited about boats, and the visitor discussed the subject in a way that seemed to me particularly interesting.</p>
<p>After he left, I spoke of him with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>What a man! My aunt informed me he was a New York lawyer, that he cared nothing whatever about boats&#x2014;that he took not the slightest interest in the subject.</p>
<p>&#x2018;But why then did he talk all the time about boats?&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Because he is a gentleman.</p>
<p>He saw you were interested in boats, and he talked about the things he knew would interest and please you.</p>
<p>He made himself agreeable.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>And William Lyon Phelps added: &#x201C;I never forgot my aunt&#x2019;s remark.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As I write this chapter, I have before me a letter from Edward L. Chalif, who was active in Boy Scout work.</p>
<p>&#x201C;One day I found I needed a favor,&#x201D; wrote Mr. Chalif.</p>
<p>A big Scout jamboree was coming off in Europe, and I wanted the president of one of the largest corporations in America to pay the expenses of one of my boys for the trip.</p>
<p>Fortunately, just before I went to see this man, I heard that he had drawn a check for a million dollars, and that after it was canceled, he had had it framed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;So the first thing I did when I entered his office was to ask to see the check.</p>
<p>A check for a million dollars!</p>
<p>I told him I never knew that anybody had ever written such a check, and that I wanted to tell my boys that I had actually seen a check for a million dollars.</p>
<p>He gladly showed it to me; I admired it and asked him to tell me all about how it happened to be drawn.&#x201D;</p>
<p>You notice, don&#x2019;t you, that Mr. Chalif didn&#x2019;t begin by talking about the Boy Scouts, or the jamboree in Europe, or what it was he wanted?</p>
<p>He talked in terms of what interested the other man. Here&#x2019;s the result:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Presently, the man I was interviewing said: &#x2018;Oh, by the way, what was it you wanted to see me about?&#x2019;</p>
<p>So I told him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;To my vast surprise,&#x201D; Mr. Chalif continues, &#x201C;he not only granted immediately what I asked for, but much more.</p>
<p>I had asked him to send only one boy to Europe, but he sent five boys and myself, gave me a letter of credit for a thousand dollars and told us to stay in Europe for seven weeks.</p>
<p>He also gave me letters of introduction to his branch presidents, putting them at our service, and he himself met us in Paris and showed us the town.</p>
<p>Since then, he has given jobs to some of the boys whose parents were in want, and he is still active in our group.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yet I know if I hadn&#x2019;t found out what he was interested in, and got him warmed up first, I wouldn&#x2019;t have found him one-tenth as easy to approach.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Is this a valuable technique to use in business? Is it? Let&#x2019;s see.</p>
<p>Take Henry G. Duvernoy of Duvemoy and Sons, a wholesale baking firm in New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Duvernoy had been trying to sell bread to a certain New York hotel.</p>
<p>He had called on the manager every week for four years.</p>
<p>He went to the same social affairs the manager attended.</p>
<p>He even took rooms in the hotel and lived there in order to get the business.</p>
<p>But he failed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then,&#x201D; said Mr. Duvernoy, &#x201C;after studying human relations, I resolved to change my tactics.</p>
<p>I decided to find out what interested this man&#x2014;what caught his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I discovered he belonged to a society of hotel executives called the Hotel Greeters of America.</p>
<p>He not only belonged, but his bubbling enthusiasm had made him president of the organization, and president of the International Greeters.</p>
<p>No matter where its conventions were held, he would be there.</p>
<p>&#x201C;So when I saw him the next day, I began talking about the Greeters.</p>
<p>What a response I got.</p>
<p>What a response!</p>
<p>He talked to me for half an hour about the Greeters, his tones vibrant with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>I could plainly see that this society was not only his hobby, it was the passion of his life.</p>
<p>Before I left his office, he had &#x2018;sold&#x2019; me a membership in his organization.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In the meantime, I had said nothing about bread.</p>
<p>But a few days later, the steward of his hotel phoned me to come over with samples and prices.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know what you did to the old boy,&#x2019; the steward greeted me, &#x2018;but he sure is sold on you!&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Think of it!</p>
<p>I had been drumming at that man for four years&#x2014;trying to get his business&#x2014;and I&#x2019;d still be drumming at him if I hadn&#x2019;t finally taken the trouble to find out what he was interested in, and what he enjoyed talking about.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Edward E. Harriman of Hagerstown, Maryland, chose to live in the beautiful Cumberland Valley of Maryland after he completed his military service.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at that time there were few jobs available in the area.</p>
<p>A little research uncovered the fact that a number of companies in the area were either owned or controlled by an unusual business maverick, R. J. Funkhouser, whose rise from poverty to riches intrigued Mr. Harriman.</p>
<p>However, he was known for being inaccessible to job seekers.</p>
<p>Mr. Harriman wrote:</p>
<p>&#x201C;I interviewed a number of people and found that his major interest was anchored in his drive for power and money.</p>
<p>Since he protected himself from people like me by use of a dedicated and stern secretary, I studied her interests and goals and only then I paid an unannounced visit at her office.</p>
<p>She had been Mr. Funkhouser&#x2019;s orbiting satellite for about fifteen years.</p>
<p>When I told her I had a proposition for him which might translate itself into financial and political success for him, she became enthused.</p>
<p>I also conversed with her about her constructive participation in his success.</p>
<p>After this conversation she arranged for me to meet Mr. Funkhouser.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I entered his huge and impressive office determined not to ask directly for a job.</p>
<p>He was seated behind a large carved desk and thundered at me, &#x2018;How about it, young man?&#x2019;</p>
<p>I said, &#x2018;Mr. Funkhouser, I believe I can make money for you.&#x2019;</p>
<p>He immediately rose and invited me to sit in one of the large upholstered chairs.</p>
<p>I enumerated my ideas and the qualifications I had to realize these ideas, as well as how they would contribute to his personal success and that of his businesses.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;R. J.,&#x2019; as he became known to me, hired me at once and for over twenty years I have grown in his enterprises and we both have prospered.</p>
<p>Talking in terms of the other person&#x2019;s interests pays off for both parties.</p>
<p>Howard Z. Herzig, a leader in the field of employee communications, has always followed this principle.</p>
<p>When asked what reward he got from it, Mr. Herzig responded that he not only received a different reward from each person but that in general the reward had been an enlargement of his life each time he spoke to someone.</p>
<p>Principle 5&#x2014;Talk in terms of the other person&#x2019;s interests.</p>

Years later, he made millions by using the same psychology in business.

For example, he wanted to sell steel rails to the Pennsylvania Railroad.

J. Edgar Thomson was the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad then.

So Andrew Carnegie built a huge steel mill in Pittsburgh and called it the “Edgar Thomson Steel Works.”

Here is a riddle.

See if you can guess it.

When the Pennsylvania Railroad needed steel rails, where do you suppose J. Edgar Thomson bought them?

From Sears, Roebuck? No. No. You’re wrong. Guess again.

When Carnegie and George Pullman were battling each other for supremacy in the railroad sleeping-car business, the Steel King again remembered the lesson of the rabbits.

The Central Transportation Company, which Andrew Carnegie controlled, was fighting with the company that Pullman owned.

Both were struggling to get the sleeping-car business of the Union Pacific Railroad, bucking each other, slashing prices, and destroying all chance of profit.

Both Carnegie and Pullman had gone to New York to see the board of directors of the Union Pacific.

Meeting one evening in the St. Nicholas Hotel, Carnegie said: “Good evening, Mr. Pullman, aren’t we making a couple of fools of ourselves?”

“What do you mean.?" Pullman demanded.

Then Carnegie expressed what he had on his mind—a merger of their two interests.

He pictured in glowing terms the mutual advantages of working with, instead of against, each other.

Pullman listened attentively, but he was not wholly convinced.

Finally he asked, “What would you call the new company?” and Carnegie replied promptly: “Why, the Pullman Palace Car Company, of course.”

Pullman’s face brightened.

“Come into my room,” he said. “Let’s talk it over.”

That talk made industrial history.

This policy of remembering and honoring the names of his friends and business associates was one of the secrets of Andrew Carnegie’s leadership.

Years later, he made millions.

He was proud of the fact that he could call many of his factory workers by their first names, and he boasted that while he was personally in charge, no strike ever disturbed his flaming steel mills.

Benton Love, chairman of Texas Commerce Bank shares, believes that the bigger a corporation gets, the colder it becomes.

“One way to warm it up,” he said, “is to remember people’s names.

The executive who tells me he can’t remember names is at the same time telling me he can’t remember a significant part of his business and is operating on quicksand.”

Karen Kirsech of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, a flight attendant for TWA, made it a practice to learn the names of as many passengers in her cabin as possible and use the name when serving them.

This resulted in many compliments on her service expressed both to her directly and to the airline.

One passenger wrote: “I haven’t flown TWA for some time, but I’m going to start flying nothing but TWA from now on.

You make me feel that your airline has become a very personalized airline and that is important to me.”

People are so proud of their names that they strive to perpetuate them at any cost.

Even blustering, hard-boiled old P. T. Barnum, the greatest showman of his time, disappointed because he had no sons to carry on his name, offered his grandson, C. H. Seeley, $25,000 dollars if he would call himself “BarnumSeeley”.

For many centuries, nobles and magnates supported artists, musicians and authors so that their creative works would be dedicated to them.

Libraries and museums owe their richest collections to people who cannot bear to think that their names might perish from the memory of the race.

The New York Public Library has its Astor and Lenox collections.

The Metropolitan Museum perpetuates the names of Benjamin Altman and J. P. Morgan.

And nearly every church is beautified by stained-glass windows commemorating the names of their donors.

Many of the buildings on the campus of most universities bear the names of donors who contributed large sums of money for this honor.

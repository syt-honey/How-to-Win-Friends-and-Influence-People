<p>I spent an evening in the dressing room of Howard Thurston the last time he appeared on Broadway &#x2014; Thurston was the acknowledged dean of magicians.</p>
<p>For forty years he had traveled all over the world, time and again, creating illusions, mystifying audiences, and making people gasp with astonishment.</p>
<p>More than 60 million people had paid admission to his show, and he had made almost $2 million in profit.</p>
<p>I asked Mr. Thurston to tell me the secret of his success.</p>
<p>His schooling certainly had nothing to do with it, for he ran away from home as a small boy, became a hobo, rode in boxcars, slept in haystacks, begged his food from door to door, and learned to read by looking out of boxcars at signs along the railway.</p>
<p>Did he have a superior knowledge of magic?</p>
<p>No, he told me hundreds of books had been written about legerdemain and scores of people knew as much about it as he did.</p>
<p>But he had two things that the others didn&#x2019;t have.</p>
<p>First, he had the ability to put his personality across the footlights.</p>
<p>He was a master showman.</p>
<p>He knew human nature.</p>
<p>Everything he did, every gesture, every intonation of his voice, every lifting of an eyebrow had been carefully rehearsed in advance, and his actions were timed to split seconds.</p>
<p>But, in addition to that, Thurston had a genuine interest in people.</p>
<p>He told me that many magicians would look at the audience and say to themselves, &#x201C;Well, there is a bunch of suckers out there, a bunch of hicks; I&#x2019;ll fool them all right.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But Thurston&#x2019;s method was totally different.</p>
<p>He told me that every time he went on stage he said to himself: &#x201C;I am grateful because these people come to see me, they make it possible for me to make my living in a very agreeable way.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m going to give them the very best I possibly can.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He declared he never stepped in front of the footlights without first saying to himself over and over: &#x201C;I love my audience. I love my audience.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ridiculous? Absurd?</p>
<p>You are privileged to think anything you like.</p>
<p>I am merely passing it on to you without comment as a recipe used by one of the most famous magicians of all time.</p>
<p>George Dyke of North Warren, Pennsylvania, was forced to retire from his service station business after thirty years when a new highway was constructed over the site of his station.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x2019;t long before the idle days of retirement began to bore him, so he started filling in his time trying to play music on his old fiddle.</p>
<p>Soon he was traveling the area to listen to music and talk with many of the accomplished fiddlers.</p>
<p>In his humble and friendly way he became generally interested in learning the background and interests of every musician he met.</p>
<p>Although he was not a great fiddler himself, he made many friends in this pursuit.</p>
<p>He attended competitions and soon became known to the country music fans in the eastern part of the United States as &#x201C;Uncle George, the Fiddle Scraper from Kinzua County.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When we heard Uncle George, he was seventy-two and enjoying every minute of his life.</p>
<p>By having a sustained interest in other people, he created a new life for himself at a time when most people consider their productive years over.</p>
<p>That, too, was one of the secrets of Theodore Roosevelt&#x2019;s astonishing popularity.</p>
<p>Even his servants loved him.</p>
<p>His valet, James E. Amos, wrote a book about him entitled Theodore Roosevelt, Hero to His Valet.</p>
<p>In that book Amos relates this illuminating incident: My wife one time asked the President about a bobwhite.</p>
<p>She had never seen one and he described it to her fully.</p>
<p>Sometime later, the telephone at our cottage rang.</p>
<p>Amos and his wife lived in a little cottage on the Roosevelt estate at Oyster Bay.</p>
<p>My wife answered it and it was Mr. Roosevelt himself.</p>
<p>He had called her, he said, to tell her that there was a bobwhite outside her window and that if she would look out she might see it.</p>
<p>Little things like that were so characteristic of him.</p>
<p>Whenever he went by our cottage, even though we were out of sight, we would hear him call out: &#x201C;Oo-oo-oo, Annie?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Oo-oo-oo, James!&#x201D;</p>
<p>It was just a friendly greeting as he went by.</p>
<p>How could employees keep from liking a man like that? How could anyone keep from liking him?</p>
<p>Roosevelt called at the White House one day when the President and Mrs. Taft were away.</p>
<p>His honest liking for humble people was shown by the fact that he greeted all the old White House servants by name, even the scullery maids.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When he saw Alice, the kitchen maid,&#x201D; writes Archie Butt, &#x201C;he asked her if she still made corn bread.</p>
<p>Alice told him that she sometimes made it for the servants, but no one ate it upstairs.</p>
<p>&#x2018;They show bad taste,&#x2019; Roosevelt boomed, &#x2018;and I&#x2019;ll tell the President so when I see him.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Alice brought a piece to him on a plate, and he went over to the office eating it as he went and greeting gardeners and laborers as he passed. . .&#x201D;</p>
<p>He addressed each person just as he had addressed them in the past.</p>
<p>Ike Hoover, who had been head usher at the White House for forty years, said with tears in his eyes:&#x201C;It is the only happy day we had in nearly two years, and not one of us would exchange it for a hundred-dollar bill&#x201D;</p>
<p>The same concern for the seemingly unimportant people helped sales representative Edward M. Sykes, Jr., of Chatham, New Jersey, retain an account.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Many years ago,&#x201D; he reported, &#x201C;I called on customers for Johnson and Johnson in the Massachusetts area.</p>
<p>One account was a drug store in Hingham.</p>
<p>Whenever I went into this store I would always talk to the soda clerk and sales clerk for a few minutes before talking to the owner to obtain his order.</p>
<p>One day I went up to the owner of the store, and he told me to leave as he was not interested in buying J&amp;J products anymore because he felt they were concentrating their activities on food and discount stores to the detriment of the small drugstore.</p>
<p>I left with my tail between my legs and drove around the town for several hours.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to go back and try at least to explain our position to the owner of the store.&#x201D;</p>

At a dinner party in New York, one of the guests, a woman who had inherited money, was eager to make a pleasing impression on everyone.

She had squandered a modest fortune on sables, diamonds and pearls.

But she hadn’t done anything whatever about her face.

It radiated sourness and selfishness.

She didn’t realize what everyone knows: namely, that the expression one wears on one’s face is far more important than the clothes one wears on one’s back.

Charles Schwab told me his smile had been worth a million dollars.

And he was probably understating the truth.

For Schwab’s personality, his charm, his ability to make people like him, were almost wholly responsible for his extraordinary success; and one of the most delightful factors in his personality was his captivating smile.

Actions speak louder than words, and a smile says, “I like you, You make me happy. I am glad to see you.”

That is why dogs make such a hit.

They are so glad to see us that they almost jump out of their skins.

So, naturally, we are glad to see them.

A baby’s smile has the same effect.

Have you ever been in a doctor’s waiting room and looked around at all the glum faces waiting impatiently to be seen?

Dr, Stephen K. Sproul, a veterinarian in Raytown, Missouri, told of a typical spring day when his waiting room was full of clients waiting to have their pets inoculated.

No one was talking to anyone else, and all were probably thinking of a dozen other things they would rather be doing than “wasting time” sitting in that office.

He told one of our classes: “There were six or seven clients waiting when a young woman came in with a nine-month-old baby and a kitten.

As luck would have it, she sat down next to a gentleman who was more than a little distraught about the long wait for service.

The next thing he knew, the baby just looked up at him with that great big smile that is so characteristic of babies.

What did that gentleman do?

Just what you and I would do, of course; he smiled back at the baby.

Soon he struck up a conversation with the woman about her baby and his grandchildren, and soon the entire reception room joined in, and the boredom and tension were converted into a pleasant and enjoyable experience.”

An insincere grin?

No. That doesn’t fool anybody.

We know it is mechanical and we resent it.

I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.

Professor James V. McConnell, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, expressed his feelings about a smile.

“People who smile,” he said, “tend to manage teach and sell more effectively, and to raise happier children.

There’s far more information in a smile than a frown.

That’s why encouragement is a much more effective teaching device than punishment.”

The employment manager of a large New York department store told me she would rather hire a sales clerk who hadn’t finished grade school, if he or she has a pleasant smile, than to hire a doctor of philosophy with a somber face.

The effect of a smile is powerful—even when it is unseen.

Telephone companies throughout the United States have a program called “phone power” which is offered to employees who use the telephone for selling their services or products.

In this program they suggest that you smile when talking on the phone.

Your “smile” comes through in your voice.

Robert Cryer, manager of a computer department for a Cincinnati, Ohio, company, told how he had successfully found the right applicant for a hard-to-fill position: I was desperately trying to recruit a Ph.D. in computer science for my department.

I finally located a young man with ideal qualification who was about to be graduated from Purdue University.

After several phone conversations I learned that he had several offers from other companies, many of them larger and better known than mine.

I was delighted when he accepted my offer.

After he started on the job, I asked him why he had chosen us over the others.

He paused for a moment and then he said: “I think it was because managers in the other companies spoke on the phone in a cold, business-like manner, which made me feel like just another business transaction,

Your voice sounded as if you were glad to hear from me . . . that you really wanted me to be part of your organization.

You can be assured, I am still answering my phone with a smile.”

The chairman of the board of directors of one of the largest rubber companies in the United States told me that, according to his observations, people rarely succeed at anything unless they have fun doing it.

This industrial leader doesn’t put much faith in the old adage that hard work alone is the magic key that will unlock the door to our desires,

“I have known people,” he said, “who succeeded because they had a rip-roaring good time conducting their business.

Later, I saw those people change as the fun became work.

The business had grown dull, They lost all joy in it, and they failed.”

You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.

I have asked thousands of business people to smile at someone every hour of the day for a week and then come to class and talk about the results.

How did it work? Let’s see. . .

Here is a letter from William B. Steinhardt, a New York stockbroker.

His case isn’t isolated.

In fact, it is typical of hundreds of cases.

“I have been married for over eighteen years,” wrote Mr. Steinhardt, “and in all that time I seldom smiled at my wife or spoke two dozen words to her from the time I got up until I was ready to leave for business.

I was one of the worst grouches who ever walked down Broadway.

When you asked me to make a talk about my experience with smiles, I thought I would try it for a week.

So the next morning, while combing my hair, I looked at my glum mug in the mirror and said to myself, “Bill, you are going to wipe the scowl off that sour puss of yours today.

You are going to smile.

And you are going to begin right now.”

As I sat down to breakfast, I greeted my wife with a “Good morning, my dear”’ and smiled as I said it.

“You warned me that she might be surprised.

Well, you underestimated her reaction.

She was bewildered.

She was shocked.

I told her that in the future she could expect this as a regular occurrence, and I kept it up every morning.

“This changed attitude of mine brought more happiness into our home in the two months since I started than there was during the last year.
